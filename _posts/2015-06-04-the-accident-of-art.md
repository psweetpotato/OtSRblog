Book: The Accident of Art; by: Sylv√®re Lotringer  
Reader: middle-age man using a flip phone  
Train: F to Manhattan  
Excerpt: "With the World Trade Center, we have an iconoclastic phenomenon that no one foresaw. There are two types of iconoclasm at least..."

This guy barely let me read a full sentence; he was flipping back and forth between pages, checking his phone, looking at me suspiciously, etc. And he completely left me hanging! What are the two types of iconoclasm? And what does the World Trade Center have to do with art?

Would I keep reading? 2/10, I'd at least finish the sentence if I was given a chance.
