Book: Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children; by: Ransom Riggs  
Reader: 20ish woman wearing leggings as pants  
Train: J to Manhattan  
Excerpt: "Gaping at me in surprise, he opened his mouth to speak but found he could not."

This book seems to be well received; I've seen it around quite a bit. However, I am unimpressed with the available excerpt. Was he already gaping or did he open his mouth to speak? I'm confused.

Would I keep reading? 4/10
