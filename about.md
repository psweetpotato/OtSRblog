OtSR was thought up on a stalled and crowded L train. I was lucky enough to be trapped against someone reading a book and took the opportunity to read along. I found myself judging the book based on the random excerpt I was able to read. However, it wasn't until I found out about Github project pages and wanted a simple project to flush out that I decided to implement my great idea and put my sneaky reading habit to good use.
